[b]BSP[/b]
(Binary Space Partitioning) compiles the physical structure of your map. This is sufficient to play your map, but there will be no visibility optimization or shadows.

[b]VIS[/b]
VIS (visibility) is for performance optimization. Compiles visibility (which parts of your map can be seen from which position - things that can't be  seen aren't rendered). Only works if your map doesn't have a leak.

[b]Light[/b]
Compiles lights and shadows.

[b]BSPC[/b]
Creates .aas files (among other things), which contain the pathing information for bots. You can't add bots to your map without an .aas file.

[b]Pause[/b]
Prevents the compiler window from closing automatically after compilation has finished so you can read the compile log."
